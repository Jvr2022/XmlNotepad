See also [Keyboard](keyboard.md) Interface.

#### Menubar
See [Menus](menus.md) for a description of each menu.

#### Toolbar
The toolbar provides shortcuts for commonly used menu commands. Hover over the toolbar buttons to see a popup showing the menu command they invoke.

#### Address
Displays the current file being edited. This is also a convenient place to enter an HTTP address for editing an online XML file.

#### XSL Output Tab
The [XSLT Output tab](xslt.md) contains a web browser-rendered view of the HTML output from an associated XSLT transformation. XSLT transforms are defined when your XML documents contain an `xml-stylesheet` processing instruction.

#### Node Values
Shows the text value of the adjacent node in the tree view. For element nodes that have children, it shows a light blue band because the text is in the child nodes.

#### Node Names
The TreeView on the left shows the XML document hierarchy in a tree, displaying element, attribute, and processing instruction names, as well as standard names for comment, text, CDATA, whitespace, and significant-whitespace nodes.

#### Intellisense
When you have an associated XSD schema, [intellisense](intellisense.md) popups will prompt with expected node names and enumerated node values.

#### XSD Annotations
When you have an associated XSD schema, the `xsd:documentation` associated with the current node is displayed in a tooltip popup and in the [Dynamic help](dynamic.md) tab.

#### Validation Errors
The Error List at the bottom shows [validation](validation.md) errors and warnings.

#### Status Bar
The status bar at the bottom shows various messages indicating the state of the program.

#### Resizers
You can move the resizers to change the ratio of space allocated to each of the main three panels.
